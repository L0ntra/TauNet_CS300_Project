Really nice documents and clean source. The SDD and STP were
quite complete. Good Git history. Good clean job overall.

Most folks were using DynDNS to cope with variable network
IPs. Is there some reason that solution wouldn't have worked
for you? I would have liked to see an echo test.

Good job.
